## How to setup
These are instructions for **OBS Studio**:
- Get the [latest release](https://github.com/Motobug/Badnik-Stream-Tool/releases).
- Extract somewhere.
- Drag and drop `Singles Scoreboard.html` into OBS, or add a new browser source in OBS pointing at the local file.
  - If the source looks weird, manually set the source's properties to 1920 width and 1080 height, or set your OBS canvas resolution to 1080p, or make the source fit the screen (Ctrl+F).
- In the source's properties, change *Use custom frame rate* -> `60` (if streaming at 60fps of course).
- Manage it all with the `Badnik Stream Tool v1.0.0` executable (or Badnik Stream Tool v1.0.0.AppImage if you are on Linux).

Repeat from the 3rd step to add the `VS Screen.html`, `Commentator Screen.html`, and `Bracket.html` views, though it is recommend you to do so on another scene.

### Interface shortcuts!
- Press `Enter` to update*.
- Press either `F1` or `F2` to increase P1's or P2's score.
- Press `ESC` to clear player info*.

***Functionality may change in some menus to ease workflow.**

For developing, there are some shortcuts to make things easier:
- Press `F5` to reload the GUI.
- Press `F12` to open the dev console. This will also unlock window resolution.

## Advanced setup
Those instructions above will get you started, but there's much more to explore. **All of this is optional** of course.

### Stream Overlays
By default, a basic overlay is provided. However, it's recommended to create your own layout using the provided template outlines in the /Resources/Overlay/Templates/ folder.

### Scene Transitions
Two basic transitions are included in the `Resources/OBS Transitions` folder, intended to be used to change to the game scene and to the VS screen, if you don't have a transition yourself of course. To use them on OBS:
- Add a new stinger transition.
- Set the video file to `Game In.webm` if creating the game scene transition, and `Swoosh.webm` if creating a VS screen transition.
- Transition point -> `350 ms`.
- I recommend you to set the Audio Fade Style to crossfade, just in case.
- On the scene's right click menu, set it to Transition Override to the transition you just created.
- Also, you may want to set a hotkey to transition to the game scene so you can press enter ingame to start the replay and press the transition key at the same time. The transition is timed to do so.

### Remote GUI

The Stream Tool GUI can be controlled remotely by any device within the local network where the GUI is running, and yes, this includes mobile devices! Please take a look at Readek's [wiki](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Tool/wiki/8.-Remote-GUI) for instructions.

## Other stuff...

### Known bugs
 - The Linux version of this application currently renders text a few pixels higher than it should; currently unsure if this is an OBS, program, or specific distribution issue.
 - Swapping between 1v1 and 2v2 mode on the fly may cause positional errors with elements onscreen until the Browser Source is refreshed in OBS
